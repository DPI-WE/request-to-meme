# Request to Meme ðŸ˜‚
This repository is an index of memes. The meme can be about anything, but it **must be workplace appropriate**. Make sure to add a link to your GitHub profile under 'submitted by' and a image source under 'source'.

## How to Contribute
Clone this repository (or open in codespace). Create an issue with a meme description you plan to add. Create a branch with the issue number, your initials and a brief description (something like this "1-ih-add-cat-meme"). Add your meme, commit, push branch, and create a pull request into main branch. Pull requests must have at least 2 approvals before being merged. Link the pull request using [closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to associate the pull request with your issue. Do not commit directly to main!
